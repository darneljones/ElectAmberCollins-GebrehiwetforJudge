            Hi I am darnel_j or Darnel L Jones Jr.
            <br />
            I am a self taught Web Developer with 5 years of professional coding
            experience. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in
            Interdisciplinary Studies with a concentration in Computer Science
            from Liberty University.
            <br />
            <br />
            I currently serve as a Sr. Technical Consultant for FINEOS Ltd, the
            leading insurance software company in the EMEA and North American
            regions. In this role I serve as a multi-regional lead technical
            consultant coding in Java and managing jenkins software deployments
            for an application hosted on AWS. I ensure company data security
            protocols are being followed throughout the SDLC. I spend most of my
            time creating, designing and developing custom features based on the
            clients business requirements. I also leverage industry leading
            integration and database troubleshooting software such as: Postman,
            SQL Developer, Docker and AWS Console.
            <br />
            <br />
            I began my career as a Debug Technician for NCR, Inc, a global
            technology company based out of Atlanta, Georgia where I specialized
            in troubleshooting computer software and hardware POS malfunctions
            for their remanufacturing depot. During this time, I was pursuing my
            degree with a focus in Computer Science to acquire a sound overall
            knowledge of Microsoft .NET, C#, Java and other OOP disciplines.
            <br />
            <br />
            After nearly 2 years with NCR, I transitioned into a developer role
            as a UI/UX Engineering Intern for Amobee, Inc an advertising and
            technology company based out of Redwood City, California. I was
            later hired as a full time UI/UX Engineer and served on the Social
            Media Engineering team. As a memeber of the UI Engineering team I
            was an active participant in daily Agile Scrum meetings, developed
            and scoped project requirements with Project Managers and Product
            Owners while providing code-coverage as the main UI developer for
            all of Amobee's Social Media campaign management platforms
            (Snapchat,Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter). It is in this role that
            I converted project requirements into front-end code using
            AngularJs, Angular versions: 1.6,2,4 & 5, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
            and TypeScript while contributing to API (Java) tasks when needed.
            This includes updating existing REST calls for the client side.
            <br />
            <br />
            After 2 years with Amobee, I relocated to Chicago, IL and
            transitioned into a ReactJs Developer role and served as a UI
            Application Architect for Bank of America-Chicago. Developing in a
            node based environment and applying my fluency in ReactJS, HTML,
            CSS, and Javascript to help build internal and customer-facing web
            applications. In this role I utilize the best practces of functional
            programming within the ReactJs library, leveraging opensource tools
            and useful plugins such as Openfin , AgGrid , ChartJs and HighCharts
            to create dynamic, responsive and custom React componenents.
